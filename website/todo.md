# To-Do List

## High Priority

- [ ] Error handling and user validation: Check to see if user registering has
      already been registered. This would be based on Student ID, university email,
      primary email. If yes, provide the user with a notification that informs them of
      the situation.

- [ ] Include a hamburger menu on the Navbar for more anchor links to other
      pages. I recommend a hamburger menu because this keep the UI clean for new
      members while still making easy for existing members to access important
      pages.

- [ ] Add a page for events that are planned and that are being planned. This
      can either be generated from markdown from the website or can just be HTML
      static pages. (I recommend static pages for now to simplify the coding
      process.)

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Add an exec member page to list to executive members of the society.
